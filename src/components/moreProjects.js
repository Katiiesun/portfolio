              For the past 4 terms, I was apart of the UW/UX team creating
              branding for our club events and initiatives, including 3 designathons.
              Earlier in the year, we rebranded our club to align closer to our values and growing vision.
             Recently, I led the branding for our FLOW designathon and merch!

              One of my tasks as a digital designer co-op was to create
              illustrations for the company website and marketing campaigns. I

              to bring out my artistic side and get more comfortable with
              Illustrator.

            <h2>
              In my visual communications class, our team of 4 designed a 3D
              goose puzzle with a flapping wings mechanism using Solidworks. We
              were inspired by the angry geese that roam campus, attacking
              innocent students, including myself ðŸ˜”.{" "}

          <h2>
            Our team originally designed a mechanism where you pull a stick from
            the goose's beak and the wings would flap outwards. However, once we
            started 3D printing our design, we dealt with various complications
            and had to pivot, simplifying our mechanism.
