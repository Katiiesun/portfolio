          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hey! I'm an aspiring product designer with a background in visual
            arts, design and engineering üé® ‚öôÔ∏è Creating art since I was young
            helped me discover that I love communicating ideas through visuals.
            Having been immersed in art and design my entire life, I find I work
            best in environments that foster creativity and innovation while
            also valuing grounded, evidence-based approaches. Problem-solving is
            at the heart of my work, and I am committed to bringing both
            creativity and reasoning to the design process üí™ Outside of
            designing, you'll likely find me sipping a matcha latte, learning my
            favourite songs on the piano, or binge watching modern family for
            the 10th time.{" "}
