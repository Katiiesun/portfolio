              As part of my internship at a leading Canadian financial services
              provider, I worked on designing a new mobile app experience for
              wealth management clients. The app complements the existing online
              investor portal and is being designed to help clients better
              understand their investments and interact seamlessly with their
              advisor team.

              This case study focuses on how we leveraged user testing to
              validate the app‚Äôs information architecture and navigation
              patterns, especially around a future navigation element that would
              enable switching between different investment views, such as all
              accounts and grouped perspectives.{" "}

          Introducing grouped investment views, a planned feature, had the
          potential to reshape the app‚Äôs information architecture and

          access and switch between different views.

        <h2>
          Although not required for the first launch, this feature needed early

          requiring major rework later.
